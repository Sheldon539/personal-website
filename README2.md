# Personal Website Portfolio

## Project Overview
This website showcases my personal journey from childhood to current academic pursuits, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technical Implementation
- **HTML**: Semantic structure for all 6 pages (Home, Childhood, Education, Skills, Future, Contact)
- **CSS**: External stylesheets for responsive design and visual consistency
- **JavaScript**: Interactive elements (e.g., form validation, animations)

## Web Hosting & Domain
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (free cloud hosting)
- **Domain**: GitHub's default `sheldon539.github.io`
- **Custom Domain Potential**: Could configure a purchased domain (e.g., `sheldon.dev`) via DNS settings

## Security Measures
- **HTTPS**: Enforced by GitHub Pages (padlock icon in browser)
- **Data Protection**: No sensitive user data collection
- **Maintenance**: Automatic updates through GitHub's infrastructure

## Accessibility & Compatibility
- ✔️ Alt text for all images
- ✔️ Keyboard-navigable content
- ✔️ Cross-browser tested (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
